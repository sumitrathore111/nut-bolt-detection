# Place your trained YOLO model file here
# The file should be named: best.pt

# After training in Google Colab, download your model:
# - Go to your Colab notebook
# - Find the training output (usually in runs/detect/train/weights/)
# - Download 'best.pt' (best performing model)
# - Place it in this folder

# The backend will automatically load it from here.
